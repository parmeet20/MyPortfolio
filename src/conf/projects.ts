      "This project is a decentralized end-to-end supply chain platform built on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. It features multiple user roles, including factory owners, product inspectors, warehouses, sellers, logistics providers, and customers. Factory owners can create factories that produce products, which are then inspected for quality. Approved products are sold to warehouses, which fulfill orders placed by sellers. Logistics providers deliver these orders to sellers, who then sell to final customers. Each product comes with a unique QR code that allows customers to trace its complete journey—from the factory floor to their hands—ensuring transparency, authenticity, and trust.",
